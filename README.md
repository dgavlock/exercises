This Repository is for exercises I am completing from [**The Odin Project Website**](https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard)!

I will also post links to work I've complete on other websites like [**CodePen**](https://codepen.io/) that I haven't moved to GitHub!

### CodePen Stuff (Currently ***Very Unpolished***)
*Check out my codepen profile* [***here***](https://codepen.io/dgavlock/)


* [My first and very sloppy "Portfolio Page"](https://codepen.io/dgavlock/pen/pZLLzE)
  * Maybe someday I will turn this into something great, *maybe*
  
* [Another Unfinished Product Landing Page](https://codepen.io/dgavlock/pen/djZgBb) 
  * This is something I also plan on glamming up a bit
  
* [Tolkien Tribute Page](https://codepen.io/dgavlock/pen/WKXbav)
  * I love J.R.R. Tolkien and you should too! I will someday make this better in his honor!
  
* [The Office Survey](https://codepen.io/dgavlock/pen/zLPGqW)
  * The Office is amazing, but this is probably the only one of these projects I will not comtinue you work on much!
  
***more to come...***
